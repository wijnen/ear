Find and fix bug that stops audio playing at a few seconds after start
This happens after a track stopped of natural causes!
Not always. It doesn't stop either, it drops out and comes back up.
Steps to reproduce:
Pavane (Orlando)
Play the whole track
Wait till it stops
Play from start
Retry this a few dozen times, sometimes it just drops out for a while.
This may have been fixed along with the 'play selection' commit


Fix the filtering of tracks and make the whole search thing in a seperate window

Optional: look at styling
